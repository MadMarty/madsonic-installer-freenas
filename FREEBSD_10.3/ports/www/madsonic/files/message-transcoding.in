Transcoding in Madsonic is a way to re-encode music on the fly to a format
your listening device supports. A common use is transcoding FLAC, WMA,
and Vorbis audio to MP3 for devices supporting only that codec.

Configuring transcoding uses up to three commands one would use on a normal
command line pipe but with a whitelist of executables installed or linked into
%%MADSONIC_HOME%%/transcode. The transcoding configuration page takes
transcoding rules in the form of:

  [rule name] [convert from] [convert to] [command 1] [command 2] 

The most compatible single audio transcoding command is with FFmpeg
